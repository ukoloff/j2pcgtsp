Hello, welcome to the PCGTSPLIB web.

The PCGTSP format uses known elements from the SOP and GTSP formats. Some new data entries are also introduced and are described below.

NAME: File name, same as before.

TYPE: Always PCGTSP

COMMENT: Name of authors

DIMENSION: Same as TSP, SOP and GTSP (number of nodes/vertices)

GROUPS: Same as GTSP (number of groups/clusters/node sets)

EDGE_WEIGHT_TYPE : Same as TSP, SOP, and GTSP, only EXPLICIT is used

EDGE_WEIGHT_FORMAT : Same as TSP, SOP, and GTSP, only FULL_MATRIX is used

NODE_WEIGHT_SECTION is a new entry, followed on the new line by an explicit enumeration of node weights/times.

EDGE_WEIGHT_SECTION is the same as for SOP although matrix entries with -1 need to be treated slightly differently.
For PCGTSP, precedence constraints are defined between groups, not nodes.
Therefore, a -1 entry is given for each node pair (n1,n2) where the corresponding group pair (g1,g2) are subject to the constraint that g2 must precede g1.

NODE_GROUP_SECTION is identical to the GTSP format.

NODE_AGENT_SECTION is a new entry, followed by a list of node agents on the next line. For instance, given the list
1 1 2 2 1
node 1, 2, and 5 belong to agent 1 while node 3 and 4 belong to agent 2.

START_GROUP_SECTION is a new entry, followed by the start group number.

EOF ends the file as usual.
